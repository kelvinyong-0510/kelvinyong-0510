# Snippet Manager Extension

## Load unpacked in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the `extension/` folder in this repository.
5. Click the Snippet Manager icon in the toolbar and choose **Open Options** to manage snippets.
6. Alternatively, go to the extension details page in `chrome://extensions` and click **Extension options**.

## Use snippet shortcuts

1. Create a snippet with a shortcut like `/invoice` and save it.
2. In any textarea or contenteditable area, type the shortcut.
3. Press space, enter, or tab to expand it into the snippet content.
4. Single-line inputs do not support line breaks, so multiline snippets will be flattened there.
